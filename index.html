                <h4>about me</h4>
                <p class="aboutme">Welcome on online portfolio of one of thousand crazy graphic designers on the world. I was born in Slovakia and now I am living my dream in Denmark. 
                I am currently studying Multimedia Design and I found it as my passion. I focus my interest on visual part and code part of this industry, because I have eye on details 
                and I can work with it until it is usable for costumers. I am working on myself to stay relevant, innovative, open for new ways of making designs and also I am open to work.
                </p>
                <p class="aboutme">I started with design and coding by myself. I watched tutorials, read books and learned from trying new things and methods. Now I can make from simple lines in HTML, 
                interactive, modern and accessible website by using CSS and little bit of Javascript. I can work with various Adobe programmes such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and XD. 
                </p>
